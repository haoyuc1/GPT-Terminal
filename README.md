# GPT-4 Server Interaction

This project allows you to interact with GPT-4, which generates server commands and chat content based on your input. It also provides the option for the user to decide whether or not to execute the generated command.

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, you need to:

1. Have Python 3.6 or later installed on your computer.
2. Install the `openai` package: `pip install openai`
3. Obtain an API key for OpenAI's GPT-4.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository or copy the Python code into a local file.
2. Run the Python script: `python server_interaction.py`
3. When prompted, provide your GPT-4 API key.

The program will guide you through the interaction process, allowing you to input questions or commands and receive responses from GPT-4. If GPT-4 generates a server command, you can decide whether or not to execute it.
